  <p>What is this shit that&rsquo;s called a government? Ok that&rsquo;s a bit harsh - the
roads, bridges, hospitals, police and doctors out there are because we have
a working government.</p>
<p>I appreciate what democracy has done for our civilisation for the past 2000
years. But when does an old system become archaic and outdated? When has it
served it&rsquo;s purpose and is no longer fit for modern society?</p>
<p>I strongly believe democracy&rsquo;s time is up and it&rsquo;s time we elect our officials
in a more thoughtful way and it all starts with WHO has a right to vote.</p>
<p><strong>tldr</strong> Not everyone should actually vote. People in power need to be
qualified before they&rsquo;re even considered for election.</p>
<h2 id="voting-rights">Voting rights</h2>
<p>Anyone over the age of 18 in Australia can vote. Voting is in fact mandatory
and you can be fined for skipping it. Yeah whatever I don&rsquo;t care about those
things. +18 year olds are smart enough and I still want people turning up at
polls.</p>
<p>I care about who among us is qualified to vote though. Dead people obviously
can&rsquo;t vote, but the brain dead? I mean that in the offensive way you&rsquo;re
hopefully reading it as.</p>
<p>If you fail to comprehend basic logic - e.g. if you&rsquo;re shown a clip of a
person saying one thing very charismatically and then doing the opposite and
you still like that person, perhaps you fail in recognising a conman from a
person who should legitimately be representing the people.</p>
<p>If you think the Earth is flat you don&rsquo;t deserve a vote. If you failed basic
math or have an IQ below 80 you probably don&rsquo;t deserve to vote. Similarly if
you&rsquo;re an old senile racist wank who won&rsquo;t vote for a person of colour for
WHATEVER reason you probably don&rsquo;t deserve a vote.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a fan of putting people up for a fair test before they&rsquo;re able to vote.
Similar to a drivers licence, anyone can get one really and people that break
too many road rules lose their licence. Voting should be a similar thing, but
we should encourage those that <em>should</em> vote to do so.</p>
<h2 id="elected-officials---a-background-on-my-beliefs">Elected officials - a background on my beliefs</h2>
<p>I find it funny a person elected to government can be given an arbitrary role
in the ministry, e.g. Health Minister - when they in fact have no medical or
health background.</p>
<p>I say this after seeing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malcolm_Turnbull">this guy</a>
get elected and be the &lsquo;Minister for Communications&rsquo;, having responsibility
over how the nations next generation of internet would be built.</p>
<p>He fucked it up. It&rsquo;s not because he&rsquo;s an idiot. No-one elected into government
is. It&rsquo;s because he has no idea about technology or the future of it in
Australia. He failed to realise HOW CRITICAL THE INTERNET WAS IN 2014. He&rsquo;s
not all to blame though, there were many around him and the Prime Minister at
the time <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Abbott">Tony Abbott</a> who is just
as responsible.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want a &lsquo;Minister for Education&rsquo; who dropped out of school at 16 and
doesn&rsquo;t believe in education.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want a &lsquo;Minister for Health&rsquo; who isn&rsquo;t a qualified health professional
and thinks vaccines are methods of control.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want a &lsquo;Minister for Women&rsquo; who has a record of misogyny and poor
behaviour against women.</p>
<p>These are three extremes, but it&rsquo;s fairly logical we need a system in place which
prevents the unqualified from representing the masses.</p>
<h3 id="minimum-requirements-to-be-an-elected-official">minimum requirements to be an elected official</h3>
<p>We need a minimum set of ministers to run a government. Education, Health,
Foreign Affairs etc <a href="https://www.pmc.gov.au/sites/default/files/publications/ministry-list-020721_0.pdf">(current list here)</a>
which should be defined/renewed every so often.</p>
<p>You need to specify what role in government you&rsquo;ll fill before election. This
is your permanent role if elected. A government is not fit to govern if they
don&rsquo;t have all the right people elected into their relevant offices.</p>
<p>Anyone wanting to become a government member needs to pass a basic set of tests
to check whether they know the ministerial role they are performing. Treasurers
should have basic accounting and math abilities and maybe an understanding of
economic principles etc.</p>
<p>We as people and a society need to be electing not just representatives, but
also qualified people for a role in government.</p>
<h3 id="more-transparency-into-finances-and-financial-backing-of-ministers">More transparency into finances and financial backing of Ministers</h3>
<p>We need to start asking ourselves how certain politicians got so damn rich.
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_current_members_of_the_United_States_Congress_by_wealth">If you look at this list for USA Congress members</a>,
someone like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nancy_Pelosi">Nancy Pelosi</a> has
amased a net worth of over +100 million (at the time of writing Oct 2021). How
is someone so rich in politics? Who knows what conversations are had between
her and her businessman husband <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Pelosi">Paul Pelosi</a>.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s these kinds of iffy relationships that leave many people disillusioned and
losing trust in the political institutions in place.</p>
<h2 id="closing-statement">Closing statement</h2>
<p><em>because we are all fed</em> - Hacker News comment I once saw when there was
discussion around why we aren&rsquo;t revolting to the institutions in place.</p>
<p>The French revolution of the 1790s led to the end of the ruling elite.
The Arab spring democratic revolutions of the 2010s led to the end of the
ruling elite.</p>
<p>There are no ruling elite in western civilisation societies. We vote for our
leaders in power. We need to change our systems of government so that we have
the best people put in place for our society to move forward and get through
issues we have as a society.</p>
