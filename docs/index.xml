      <description>Cryptocurrencies are bad for the environment. It&amp;rsquo;s an incredibly ineffecient way of processing transactions. It&amp;rsquo;s a bit like burning a forest as a way of keeping your neighbourhood warm. I say these when looking at the more popular cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum but to a degree, they apply to all of them.
Crypto also offers an avenue of transactions which are absent of any governing or financial regulatory systems. They rely on distributed parties agreeing whether transactions should proceed or not as opposed to a singular body which can authoritatively approve or deny a transaction.</description>

      <description>It wasn&amp;rsquo;t always like this, at least not for as long as I remember. I&amp;rsquo;m watching this great catastrophe happen in front of me and I can&amp;rsquo;t help but feel helpless.
Let&amp;rsquo;s first rewind to when being a &amp;lsquo;millionaire&amp;rsquo; was something to aspire to. Having a million dollars meant you could do nearly anything you want. My memories of this feeling was in the late 90s and probably crept into the early 2000s.</description>
