We fucked it up. We let the delta variant get a strong hold on us as a
population and **it's here to stay**.

It wasn't even 3 months ago, things were really looking up in the trans-
oceanic area. There were talks of a travel bubble opening up, I even got to
holiday with my partner in New Zealand in June. When we got back though, we
faced a long lockdown which we're still in today. It's mostly because I/We
got complacent about COVID-19 and how like viruses are suppose to, this one
mutated into a more dangerous and transmissible strain.

## My beliefs before it turned to shit

I'm not an anti-vaxxer, but I didn't think I needed the vax. I looked around at
the world and thought, "Fuck Australia and first world countries are stealing/
getting priority for vaccinations over countries that need it more!". That
sentiment and the safety I felt in Australia of not ever getting COVID led me
to think that the vaccine wasn't necessary.

I'm wrong on both believes. Especially the one where I thought we could survive
a post-covid world with no effort on my part to take the vaccine.

## Getting vaxxed

I signed up for the Astrazenica shot as it was available to my age group (30-
40s male). At the time, it was widely believed by most people that this was
the more 'risky' vaccine option and I might get bloodclots - this was sadly
a failure on my part to properly look into the information FOR this vaccine as
well as people around me telling me there were health implications with this
vaccine.

Nevertheless, I've got my first dose and I'll do a second dose when it's close
to the 12 week mark as that's reportedly the best time for a second shot. I
strongly feel a failure by everyone as a whole (easy to point and blame
governments / media but really we should look inwards).

## Why you SHOULD be vaxxed

Everyone should get it. Variants like delta are so transmissible (or catchy
as I like so say) that I believe we'll all be exposed to the virus eventually
as if it's the common cold/flu.

We need to train our bodies for immunity and vaccines are a starting point.
Don't believe the bullshit like what [Bret Weistein](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmy8znrLPc0)
says about vaccines putting evolutionary pressure on the virus to mutate.
The only way to stop the virus is to minimise the spreading (more virus cells,
more chance of mutation). The vaccine trains your body against a dumb version
of the vaccine to give YOU protection. Keep in mind this guy also thought the
the virus was manufactured in a lab, but here he's pushing this evolution/
mutation narrative. Yeah it's totally not possible for a virus to mutate and
jump species - musta been them copycat chinese that steal all our tech
including the ability to manufacture bioweapo...

_...he talks slow for stupid people_

## Being in lockdown.

Wow it's quite shit. My partner and I worked from home for most of 2020 and it
was great. Lockdown however is not just working from home - it's being confined
to home. You're basically a prisoner and at the time of writing, we're not
suppose to go outside the 5km radius of where we live (bit over 3 miles for
imperial unit scum).

I've slowly start so see the real poison of lockdown. I appreciate all the
healthcare workers and what they're battling through and why we're in
lockdown. We don't want a flood of people heading into the hospitals and
filling up ICU beds (see point above above about getting vaxxed). We're
currently waiting for that 70% of the state fully vaxxed before we can get
our freedoms back, which brings me onto my last point.

## Antilockdown protestors were always going to win

Locking down is not a long term solution and no country can build a wall/bubble
to protect themselves from the rest of the world. Australia was the big brother
who tried this and New Zealand is our little brother who thinks they can do a
better job of it (they're smarter than us after all!).

The rest of the world was in lockdown for the better part of 2020 and now we're
suffering our 'turn' in mid-2021. It's eye opening and I really can't see
people willingly do a long stint of this again. So yeah, maybe those
anti-lockdown protestors had the foresight that lockdowns would eventually be
eased and they needed to take to the streets to get their point across.

Who knows - these past few years have been unpredictable and more nightmarish
than I wish to acknowledge. 2016 was where it all started going so very wrong.
